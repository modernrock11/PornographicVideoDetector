// Update the include path in your project's configuration file

// For example, if you are using CMake, you can add the following line to your CMakeLists.txt file:

// include_directories("path/to/SDKDDKVer.h")

// If you are using Visual Studio, you can update the include path in the project properties:

// Right-click on the project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> VC++ Directories -> Include Directories

// Add the path to the directory containing SDKDDKVer.h

#include <SDKDDKVer.h>
